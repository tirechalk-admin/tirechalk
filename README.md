# Tire Chalk

Welcome to **Tire Chalk** – a crowdsourcing reporting platform where tire admirers unite to celebrate the art of chalk scribbles on wheels, one curious gaze at a time!  

This repository is **not the main application code**. It is currently used solely for opening **issues and discussions** related to the Tire Chalk site.  

> ⚠️ **Note:** The **Tire Chalk API** and **frontend** will be opened to contributors soon. Stay tuned if you’re interested in contributing to the core project!
